## Description
"This repository contains a snippet (less than 30 lines) that creates a landing page, closely resembling the homepage of the fintech company Zerodha, using only HTML and CSS. It serves as a valuable resource for beginners, illustrating how to make a browser render a webpage similar to a specific site, employing VSCode, HTML, and CSS.

In simple terms, the HTML file structures the webpage's content, while CSS stylizes it, making it visually appealing and interactive. The Flexbox layout module stands out as the most convenient method for positioning or aligning elements on the webpage interface, such as buttons.

The 'creation.html' file demonstrates the creation of a basic webpage using only HTML. It shows how to add content like images, buttons, a hamburger icon, hyperlinks, etc., to the page.

For a more refined look, the 'LandingPg_Zerodha.html' file illustrates how to add styles like color and spacing to the basic webpage's content. Two snippets are provided: Snippet 1 presents a plain interface without hyperlinks, while Snippet 2 includes hyperlinks. Clicking on options such as 'Sign up now' redirects the user to the actual Sign-Up page of Zerodha, offering a practical understanding of anchor tags."
